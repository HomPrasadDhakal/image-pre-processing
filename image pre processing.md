  Image pre-processing are the steps you take to convert the images in it's raw form into a form that your model is ready to use for tranning and inference. Images can be of different sizes, orientation, contrast level, image pre-processing is the data cleaning for the computer vision.
  
  As a Machine Learning Engineer, data pre-processing or data cleansing is a crucial step and most of the ML engineers spend a good amount of time in data pre-processing before building the model. Some examples for data pre-processing includes outlier detection, missing value treatments and remove the unwanted or noisy data.

Similarly, Image pre-processing is the term for operations on images at the lowest level of abstraction. These operations do not increase image information content but they decrease it if entropy is an information measure. The aim of pre-processing is an improvement of the image data that suppresses undesired distortions or enhances some image features relevant for further processing and analysis task. 

## Steps involved in image pre-processing
There are 4 different types of Image Pre-Processing techniques and they are listed below.

1. Pixel brightness transformations/ Brightness corrections
2. Geometric Transformations
3. Image Filtering and Segmentation 
4. Fourier transform and Image restauration
